# The FormETCS Project

FormETCS was a joint research project of Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt and Deutsche Bahn AG between 2017 and 2021.
The goal was to speed up the planning of railway lines, equipped with the European Train Control System (ETCS), for the German railway network.
Especially the following topics were investigated:

- Formalization of the German ETCS planning rulebooks (Ril 819.1340 - 819.1348)
- Identifying gaps in the rulebooks
- Finding solutions to automate the creation and verification of ETCS plans
